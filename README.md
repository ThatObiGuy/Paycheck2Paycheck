# Paycheck2Paycheck
A Shiny app to help people living "Paycheck2Paycheck" to see if they're spending too fast.

Intention is to have an easy-to-use webapp that will take in spending from a user on one side and populate a graph in the main section.
This graph will fit a line to the spending, and through a series of informative & humours images, indicate to the user if they're going to make it through to their next paycheck with any money.

INPUTS:
->  PAYCHECK AMOUNT
->  DAYS UNTIL NEXT PAYCHECK
->  CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS RENT (Most people's largest expense)
->  DAY-BY-DAY AGGREGATE SPENDING

# Inspiration
This is being developed as my application to the 2024/2025 Maynooth Data Science "Shiny App Developement Competition".
I wanted to try and make a shiny app, although the app and idea are basic, this was a great opportunity to play around with shiny, see how the server and ui interact, and especially the range of features, one of the coolest being the file upload/download.

# Acknowledgment - future improvement
Initial solution is rough. This is not the intended use case of a linear model, the focus is more on the use of shiny and learning the enviroment. Yet there is ample ways to improve, I feel this is one of the strenghts of the projects, with every update I can see more paths which could be explored for it's continued improvement.
I feel it was a good project to get familiar with Shiny. Dynamic visualisation, and introduction to features like react, drop-down menus and download/upload.
It was key to be concious of time when deciding scope of project.
mentioned in demo video but we'll possibly be capable of a more sophisticated solution upon completion of the time series module.
By definition it can be hard to make predictions with such a limited scope of time, a more meaningful budgeting tool I feel may be one that sits on top of exsisting banking apps like revolut and gives insights based on having your entire history of data available.

Thanks for checking it out!
