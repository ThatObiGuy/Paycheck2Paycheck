# Paycheck2Paycheck
A Shiny app to help people living "Paycheck2Paycheck" to see if they're spending too fast.

This is being developed as my application to the 2024/2025 Maynooth Data Science "Shiny App Developement Competition"

Intention is to have an easy-to-use webapp that will take in spending from a user on one side and populate a graph in the main section.
This graph will fit a line to the spending and through a series of informative & humours images indicate to the user if they're going to make it through the month/period with any money.
